# Project Description

This project seeks to replicate the primary findings of the paper “A Single-Cell Transcriptomic Map of the Human and Mouse Pancreas Reveals Inter- and Intra-Cell Population Structure.” by Barom M. et al by using sequencing data from a single human donor in order to perform cell-by-gene quantification and quality control on UMI counts as well as identify clusters marker genes for distinct cell type populations.
